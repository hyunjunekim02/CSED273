# CSED273 Digital System Design

Welcome to the repository for the Digital System Design Lab Assignments for the Spring 2022 session of CSED273 @ POSTECH! This course dives into the the basic computer architecture and basic computer circuits covering key concepts such as 2's complement, Adder, MUX, Flip-Flop, and FSM.

## Overview

The lab assignments are implemented in Verilog. Here's the overview below:

1. **Lab 1**: Basic Logic Circuit
2. **Lab 2**: Boolean Algebra
3. **Lab 3**: Decoder and Multiplexer
4. **Lab 4**: Binary Arithmetic
5. **Lab 5**: ALU and JKFF
6. **Lab 6**: Sequential Circuit Counter
7. **Final Project**: Simple Moore or Mealy Machine and its Application

Each lab builds upon the knowledge and skills developed in the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity and requiring a comprehensive understanding of concepts

## Notes

Please be advised that the code provided might contain minor errors. Always cross-check with your understanding and learning material before utilizing the code for your projects or studies.
